# InventoryManagement
This is an inventory management web application for use by a Reddit user.


The following items should be installed before running the InventoryApplication:
- MongoDB (https://www.mongodb.org/downloads) if running a local copy of an inventory datastore.  If a cloud service is being used then this step is optional.
- Node.js (http://nodejs.org/download/) for the server platform for the web application.
- Express (installed via "npm install express" command after installing Node.js) for the web framework.
- Angular.js (packaged with the InventoryManagement application) for the frontend framework.
